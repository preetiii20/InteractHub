# InteractHub
To design and develop a centralized collaboration platform where employees across departments (like HR, Finance, IT, and Marketing) can communicate, share updates, manage inter-departmental projects, and approve requests â€” all in one secure, real-time portal.

The main objective is to break departmental silos in organizations and enhance transparency, speed, and teamwork.
